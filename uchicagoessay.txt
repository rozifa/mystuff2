From a very young age my time was mostly occupied by drawing. I created my own characters and eventually composed entire comic books revolving around them. I used whatever tools I could find to staple together one of a kind copies of my books. If I wanted access to new colors or mediums, I had to buy new art supplies.

As my interests in the area evolved, I had to learn to use new tools. Technology was my greatest aid. With a computer I had access to every color and I could simulate every medium. It was intriguing and fun. The progression of technology along with my curiosity eventually lead me toward a variety of technical fields. First, I made the logical progression toward computer animation. Then I made my projects interactive and unique by incorporating programming to make games using my animations.

As I aged, I moved closer toward the technical aspects of computers. I drew less and I rarely made any comic books. I became focused on programming. Periodically, I remembered my times as a "young artist" and asked myself how I had arrived at that point. Had I lost interest in creativity? Was my change just a normal result of maturity? Or had I arrived at a paradoxical state? - A paradox that wasn't impossible but rather fundamental to my character and to my productivity. I was still creative. I had just begun using a different approach towards creation, a new set of tools. Solving problems and creating programs require creativity. There is no amount of knowledge of programming syntax, keywords, or hardware that can take the place of creativity. Similarly, no amount of knowledge about a brush or a set of markers makes an artist excellent. An excellent artist uses tools in a unique way to create a cohesive whole with meaning. An excellent programmer does the same but uses a language or framework to achieve a similar goal. Solving problems requires creative approaches. I find it most stimulating when I can use my creativity to solve a problem. When I can employ logic in a creative way.

When I can break free of traditional approaches and find new and efficient solutions.

I embrace this duality of logic and creativity. It turns out that this "paradox" describes a much more complex relationship of interdependency and entanglement. Even this essay which I wrote it in a text editor meant for programming and saved using a version control system for software development exists within this paradox of technology and creativity.
