I'm ready to create. I want to dive into research and projects while continuing to learn. I am eager to apply skills and learn new and relevant ones. My particular interests in computer science are centered around machine learning/AI/optimization, statistical analysis/modeling, and its direct applications in solving socioeconomic problems. The University of Chicago offers excellent opportunities in these areas through their artificial intelligance sequence and advanced systems sequence courses. I value this curricular approach because it allows me to focus on areas that I am truly passionate about and delve into applications of computer science rather than simply exploring theory. Similarly, the university's research program in machine learning strongly appeals to me. The ability to conduct research during my years at the University of Chicago is a unique opportunity that allows me to challenge myself through relevant applications of my knowledge. I love to solve challenging problems and puzzles. I derive no greater joy than when I solve a problem that has been endlessly bugging me. I believe that the University of Chicago's unique computer science program will allow me to pursue my passions and prepare me to create and invent solutions to relevant problems.
